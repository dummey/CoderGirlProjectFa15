## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a low-cost personalized text-to-speech system designed for use by those with motor or speech limitations. It takes inspiration from this awesome work https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/ and aims at reproducing limited, but streamlined functionality specifically for providing mobile speech assitance.
